                    <div class="back">
                        The combustion chamber is where the energy is transformed in the combustion process. This is the area of the engine in which the fuel, air, electricity, and pressure have an explosive reaction that causes the pistons to move up and down. The movement of the pistons gives the car the power to move.

                    </div>
                    <div class="back">The crankshaft is the part of the engine that rounds out the up and down motion of the pistons. It is connected to rubber belts which are connected to the camshaft allowing for power to be delivered to various parts of the car. The camshaft is connected to the drive train which is the part that transfers power to the wheels.

                        The valves in an engine are the intake valves and the outtake valves. Intake valves work to transfer the air and fuel levels into the combustion chamber. The outtake valves work to move the exhaust that is created from the combustion out of the chamber.

                    </div>
                    <div class="back">The core is the major part of a radiator that serve its main purpose. It is a metal block with small metal fins which through it the coolant heat is a vent to the air surrounding the radiator. Cores are used to classified radiators, for instance, one-core, two-core, or even three-core radiators.

                    </div>
                    <div class="back">As the coolant in the radiator is always under pressure, which helps to keep the coolant much hotter under without boiling. This allows the system to be much more efficient. The function of the pressure cap is to bleed off the hot coolant since it rises at some point. The hot coolant could cause damage to the coolant parts if the pressurize cap not functioning well.

                    </div>
                    <div class="back">Some cars use the same cooler as the engine transmission cooler. In the transmission system, the fluid passes through a steel pipe to ensure the coolant circulation. This coolant is also cooled within the radiator because heat is also generated through an automatic transmission. Although some engines are designed with separate radiator for the transmission.

                    <div class="back">Automatic transmissions have planetary gear sets that consist of the sun gear, planet gears, and ring gear. These gears move and interact together, which allows the car to attain a range of forward and reverse speeds.</div>

                    <div class="back">The clutch pack inside of an automatic transmission is comprised of several discs inside of a drum. To facilitate gear shifts in an automatic transmission, a piston inside the drum squeezes the clutch pack together using oil pressure, which locks the components of the clutch pack together.

                    </div>
                    <div class="back">Located between the engine and the gears, the torque convertor prevents the car from stalling while idling by keeping the transmission disengaged from the engine. When you press on the gas pedal, more fluid goes into the torque converter, which allows more power to flow from the engine to the transmission.

                    <div class="back">Brake calipers or calipers are an essential component in disc brakes in cars. Calipers will perform a mechanical movement to clamp the brake lining on the disc. Calipers are also often referred to as brake pads and piston brakes.
